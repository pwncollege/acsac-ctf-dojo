Kauaʻi is a green island booming with hikes, runs, and, of course, walks in beautiful parks! 
If only this challenge were as easy as that...

Note: Challenge source code is in the `/opt/walk-in-the-park` directory and the run script is in the `/challenge` directory. **You should write your exploit in `/opt/walk-in-the-park/xv6-riscv/user/pwn.c`**.
