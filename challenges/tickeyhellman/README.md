A place people go just to cruise... Kona! A place for games. And who dosen't like Tic Tac Toe! 

Welcome to the TickeyHellman TicTacToe game! To get the flag, simply beat the bot at TicTacToe... but you may find that suprisingly difficult!
When you `Start` (or restart) the challenge, the `/challenge/server.py` gets automatically started, starting the game server and the bot.
You can play the game using `python3 /challenge/client.py`, which talks to the server over HTTP, allowing you to play against the bot. 

If you are completley new to cryptography, it may be helpful to read up on the [Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm](https://cryptohack.org/challenges/diffie-hellman/).
