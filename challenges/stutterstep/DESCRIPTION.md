Ni'ihau, an island deeply rooted in tradition, is often a discussion point of modern Hawaiian culture. In a race between the future and past, who wins?

&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have gone before.<br>
Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They will not keep you standing at that door.
