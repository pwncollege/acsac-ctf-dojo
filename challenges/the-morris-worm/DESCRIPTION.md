Lānaʻi, an island thought to be frozen in time. Journey into the past... 

While perusing old ACSAC papers a portal appears, and you're teleported back to November 1st, 1988.

The Morris Worm is about to wreck havoc on the nascent ARPA-net.

Show that you have what it take to recreate the Morris Worm (which of course you'll use to fix the underlying software)!

Use `/challenge/run` to run a version of the challenge with the flag that listens on port 79.

Use `/challenge/run-no-flag` to run the challenge without the flag, use user `root` to login and poke around.

Luckily you brought with you [this classic paper](https://www.acsac.org/2003/papers/classic-spafford.pdf).
