Aloha! A special chat server has sprung up in the heart of Maui’s digital rainforest—its name is Pono ʻĀlani, "Balanced Orange". This chatroom claims to be secure, with messages safely concealed and admins lurking only behind the shimmering veil of the local network. However, locals whisper that the code beneath these island skies might not be as secure as it seems. They say that with the right knowledge, you can bend the wind and sway the palm trees of encryption in your favor.

Your quest? Traverse this island’s web server, uncover its secrets, and claim the precious treasure hidden within. Careful manipulation of logins, subtle exploitation of native binaries, and skillful cryptographic maneuvers will guide you to the hidden lei of victory. The system may try to keep the admins close to home, but with cunning, you might just convince it that you belong on the inside.

To begin your adventure, simply run `/challenge/run`. This will drop you into an isolated shell where the challenge awaits. Explore, experiment, and uncover the secrets hidden in this secluded digital paradise—but remember, the treasures you seek are confined to the boundaries of this shell and its descendants.

Don’t forget to harvest knowledge and skill from the mainland—if you find yourself shipwrecked on the reef of confusion, a journey to the Orange Belt at [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/intro-to-cybersecurity/) may guide you through the swirling currents of this challenge.

**Ho‘omau ka pono!** Press on until you claim the forgotten lei of victory.
