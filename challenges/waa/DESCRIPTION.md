All great journies begin at the sea! Get your Wa'a (canoe) and begin your journey with Māui!

This challenge is a sanity check to help you understand the CTF infrastructure. 

Thank you for playing participating in ACSAC CTF.

In all of the challenges the challenge items will be located in `/challenge/` directory.

Practice mode gives you access to `sudo` so you can debug challenges using root permissions. Flag will be replaced with `pwn.college{practice}`.

Your goal is to submit the flag written in `/flag` file.

To run the challenge binary: `/challenge/run`.

Good Luck!
