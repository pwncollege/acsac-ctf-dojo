O'ahu, known as "the gathering place", is an island for many minds to come together... and the location of this year's ACSAC! Where else would you submit your work?!?!

After years of harsh paper rejections and unreasonable revision demands, it's time to upgrade our reviewing system. This year, only at ACSAC CTF, reviewers have been replaced by AI, giving you constructive feedback to your paper submissions within a couple of minutes. Our cutting-edge system promises unbiased reviews through state-of-the-art language models. We anticipate all conferences to switch to this system soon.

Your task: submit a paper and see if you can get a 'Strong Accept' decision from our AI reviewer.
          
The challenge is hosted externally: https://acsac24-hotcrp.hackpack.club/acsac24/

Once you get the challenge flag, start this challenge and run `/challenge/solve` to get the real flag. 

## Hint

1. The only thing that is input to the LLM is the PDF: the paper title and abstract do not matter.

2. The LLM generates an offline hotcrp template, [a copy of which you can find here](https://acsac-2024-ctf.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hotcrp-review-1.txt), which is then loaded as the review.
