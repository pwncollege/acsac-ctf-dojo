the constellations are well aligned, this is the time
you need to read that secret file before it expires
the big brother gave me this program that can read any secret files on the system
but the big brother has his own ways of doing things


hint :
big brother modified it before giving us, he is deceiving us. the variables in the code aren't always what they look like. word around the place is that he expects us to rely on the existing tools too much, maybe we need to think differently. take care!
