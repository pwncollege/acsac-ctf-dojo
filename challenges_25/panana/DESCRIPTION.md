- Difficulty: `tutorial`
- Author: `mahaloz`

To navigate the stars, you must first orient yourself within the world.
Where are you now? Where are you going? You need a guide.

The Pānānā (compass) guides you, showing you the way to the greater stars of the universe.

This challenge is a sanity check to help you understand the CTF infrastructure. 
Thank you for playing participating in ACSAC CTF.

In all of the challenges the challenge items will be located in `/challenge/` directory.

Practice mode gives you access to `sudo` so you can debug challenges using root permissions. Flag will be replaced with `acsacctf{practice}`.

Your goal is to submit the flag written in `/flag` file.

To run the challenge binary: `/challenge/run`.

Good Luck!
